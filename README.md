Image Captioning Using Transformers on Flicker8K Dataset

This project implements a transformer model for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks, focusing on machine translation. The transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., is known for its ability to handle long-range dependencies in sequences and has become a standard for various natural language processing tasks.

The implemented transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequences and produces a context representation, capturing the meaning of the input. The decoder takes this context representation and generates the output sequences token by token, conditioned on the input and the previously generated tokens.

Key components of the transformer model include multi-head self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequences, and position-wise feed-forward networks, which provide additional capacity for modeling complex relationships in the sequences. Layer normalization and dropout are applied throughout the model to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

The model is trained using a custom learning rate schedule and the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training process involves iterating over the dataset for a specified number of epochs, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters using the Adam optimizer. The project also includes functionality for saving and restoring checkpoints, allowing training to be resumed from a saved state.

Overall, this project demonstrates the implementation of a transformer model for sequence-to-sequence learning, showcasing its effectiveness in handling machine translation tasks. The modular nature of the transformer architecture and its components make it a versatile choice for various sequence processing tasks beyond machine translation.
